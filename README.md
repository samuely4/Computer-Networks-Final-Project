# Computer-Networks-Final-Project

* This Repository contains the final project of Computer Networks (graduate-level class at the City College of New York).
* The files for the project can be found in a file named op_models.

## Abstract

In this project, we constructed a network with 7 nodes. We simulated and
analyzed how data travels from node to node and gathered different statistics both at the “object
level” as well as at the “global level”. Finally, we provided step by step procedure of using the
OPNET software to simulate a 7-node network system. We used two different protocols to
simulate: RIP protocol and OSPF protocol. The next section explains the difference between
these two protocols. In addition, we also compared simulated values using RIP with simulated
values using OSPF.
